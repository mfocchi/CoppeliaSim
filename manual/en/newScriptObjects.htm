Script objects
</h1>

<p><a href="simulationScripts.htm">Simulation scripts</a> and <a href="customizationScripts.htm">customization scripts</a> are now, as of CoppeliaSim V4.7, <a href="objects.htm">scene objects</a> on their own:</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/newScriptObjects.png"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Associated vs attached scripts]</p>


<p> This simplifies the way those scripts are created, handled and destroyed. Additionally, there is no limit anymore to the number of scripts a scene object can have attached, thus code and functionality can better be compartmentalized:</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/newScriptObjects2.png"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Object with several scripts attached, each with a different function]</p>


<p> Associated scripts are still supported, and they will operate in parallel to the new script objects. However, it is recommended to not use them anymore.</p>
<p> <a name="conversion" id="conversion"></a>Older scenes and models can be automatically ported to scene objects by setting the <a href="commandLine.htm#settingsFile">user settings</a> parameter <em>scriptConversion</em> to 1. This converts associated scripts to script objects in a compatibility mode:</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/parentAsProxy.png"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Script object compatibility mode (<em>Parent as proxy</em> enabled)]</p>



<p>The compatibility mode allows most older scenes and models to run seamlessly within the new script object framework. Best is however to disable the compatibility mode (uncheck <em>Parent as proxy</em>) and adjust the related script code.</p>
<p>With script objects, the interpreter language is fixed upon script creation, and does not need to be specified as a comment in the code anymore.</p>
